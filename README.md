🚀 Building a Smarter Research Future with Lightweight Multi-Agent AI Systems

It is an innovative lightweight, multi-agent system powered by LangGraph and chat models to redefine and personalize the research process. This system brings efficiency, precision, and flexibility to research through the seamless integration of AI and human collaboration. Here's how: 

🔍 Source Selection 
- Users have the freedom to select custom input sources, tailoring research to their specific needs. 

📝 with AI Analysts 
- Users provide a topic, and the system automatically generates a team of AI analysts, each specializing in a distinct sub-topic. 
- Human-in-the-loop feedback ensures precise sub-topic refinement before the research begins. 

🤖 In-depth LLM-Powered Interviews 
- Each AI analyst conducts multi-turn interviews with expert AI models using the latest research methodologies (inspired by the STORM paper). 
- These interviews are captured within sub-graphs to maintain contextual depth and internal state tracking throughout the process. 

⚡ Parallel Research Process with Map-Reduce 
- All interviews are conducted simultaneously and in parallel to accelerate insights gathering. 
- The map-reduce framework ensures a smooth and comprehensive aggregation of findings from multiple perspectives. 

📊 Customizable Output Format
- Insights from individual interviews are synthesized into a tailored final report, allowing for dynamic prompts to meet diverse reporting needs.

With this system, we aim to transform research workflows, enabling faster, smarter, and more collaborative outcomes. This is not just research reimagined—it’s research empowered by AI-driven multi-agent collaboration. 🚀
